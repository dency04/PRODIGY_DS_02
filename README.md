# PRODIGY_DS_02 - Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Task Description
In this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns that influenced passenger survival. The project includes handling missing values, visualizing survival distributions, and exploring relationships between features such as age, fare, and passenger class.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Steps
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset
- Handled missing values
- Visualized:
  - Survival counts
  - Age distribution
  - Survival by class, age, and fare
  - Correlation heatmap
